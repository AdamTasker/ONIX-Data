# ONIX-Data
This solution is a C# library that serves to provide .NET data structures (and an accompanying set of helpful parsers) for the ONIX XML format, which is the international standard for representing the electronic data regarding books (along with other media).

NOTE: Since validation of ONIX files has proven problematic on the .NET platform, there is an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jaerith/ONIX-Validator">accompanying Java project</a> that can serve to validate those files instead.
